# CloudBase Spec Workflow Power

A comprehensive software engineering workflow framework for requirement analysis, technical design, and task planning, ensuring high-quality development processes for CloudBase projects.

## Overview

This power provides a structured software engineering workflow for developing new features and complex systems, including:

- Standardized requirement analysis using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- Technical solution design and architecture planning
- Task breakdown and project management
- Integration with UI design and database design workflows
- Quality assurance and acceptance criteria definition

## Key Features

- **Structured Workflow**: Four-phase development process with user confirmation gates
- **EARS Requirements**: Standardized requirement syntax for clarity and precision
- **Technical Design**: Comprehensive solution architecture and technology selection
- **Task Management**: Detailed task breakdown and progress tracking
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in acceptance criteria and validation processes
- **Integration Ready**: Seamless integration with UI and database design workflows

## Use Cases

- Developing new features from scratch
- Designing complex system architectures
- Integrating multiple modules and services
- Projects involving database design and optimization
- Projects requiring UI/UX design and implementation
- Ensuring high-quality requirement analysis and acceptance criteria

## Workflow Phases

1. **Requirements Document and Acceptance Criteria Design**
2. **Technical Solution Design**
3. **Task Breakdown and Planning**
4. **Task Execution and Tracking**

## Important Notes

- Each phase must be completed and confirmed by user before proceeding
- Never skip phases or proceed without user confirmation
- Use EARS syntax for requirement descriptions
- Reference UI design rules when requirements involve frontend pages
- Maintain task status updates throughout execution
